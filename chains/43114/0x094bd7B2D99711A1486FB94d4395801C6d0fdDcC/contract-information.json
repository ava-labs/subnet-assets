  "description": "TEDDY is a token that captures the fee revenue generated by the Teddy Cash Protocol via staking. Teddy Cash is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against AVAX used as collateral. Loans are paid out in TSD and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing TSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort.\r\n\r\nTeddy Cash as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free."
