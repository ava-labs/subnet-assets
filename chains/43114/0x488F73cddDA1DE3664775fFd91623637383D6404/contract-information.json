    "description": "\"YetiSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and NFT marketplace , running on the Avalanche blockchain. Yeti Swap uses the same automated market-making (AMM) model as Uniswap and features a native governance token called YTS that is fully community driven, with users capable of trading all native Avalanche tokens. In a crowded marketplace with multiple contenders, YetiSwap offers three critically important benefits: fast and cost-efficient trades, with a fair and open token distribution system.\r\nYetiSwap is the only NFT marketplace offering royalties on Avalanche, profiting both NFT artists and collection owners.\""
