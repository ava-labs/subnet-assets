    "description": "Baklava Space is designed as a combination of automated yield farming for your LP tokens and a synthetic creation mechanism using LP tokens. \r\n\r\nIn Baklava Space, users keep 100% their original LP tokens and at the same time, Baklava is optimising the yield from user's LP token by actively auto-compounding the LP with lowest possible cost (all APY shown have already included fees), earning $BAVA rewards, and (soon) earning synthetic asset profits.",
