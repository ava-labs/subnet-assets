    "description": "The $KING algorithmic token serves as the backbone of:\r\nrapidly growing ecosystem aimed towards bringing\r\nliquidity and new use cases to the Avalanche blockchain. The\r\nprotocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $KINGâ€™s supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $AVAX.\r\n\r\nInspired by tomb.finance, who was originally inspired by the idea behind Basis as well as its predecessors, king finance is a multi-token protocol which consists of the following three tokens:\r\n- King Finance ($KING)\r\n- KING Shares ($KSHARE) \r\n- KING Bonds ($KBOND)",
