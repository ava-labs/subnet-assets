  "description": "Castle Crush is a real-time strategy mobile game published by Wildlife Studios. It is originally a web2 game, with a new NFT + Crypto layer being added to it through the use of a custom Avalanche subnet. NFTs are playable in-game minions and spells that players can truly own, buy, sell, and loan. A new token, $ACS, will power the game's crypto economy."
